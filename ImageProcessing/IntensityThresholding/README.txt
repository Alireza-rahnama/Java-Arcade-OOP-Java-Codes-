
this program applis 4 different algorithms of thresholding including three global methods such as auto, manual, and Otsu's thresholding, as well as the Adaptive Mean-C algorithm. 
The image canvas on the left displays the input image and the right image canvas displays the image after aplying threshold on the image. 
The histogram is displayed on the plot primarily before applying any methods.
The computed threshold is displayed with vertical red color bar on the histogram of the input image.
